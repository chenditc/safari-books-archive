First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers.</p><p><a id="iddle1208" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1222" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1765" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2027" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2069" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2183" class="indexterm"></a>This is a book about good programming. It is filled with code. We are going to look at code from every different direction. We’ll look down at it from the top, up at it from the bottom, and through it from the inside out. By the time we are done, we’re going to know a lot about code. What’s more, we’ll be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code. We’ll know how to write good code. And we’ll know how to transform bad code into good code.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lev1sec1"></a>There Will Be Code</h1></div></div></div><p>One might argue that a book about code is somehow behind the times—that code is no longer the issue; that we should be concerned about models and requirements instead. Indeed some have suggested that we are close to the end of code. That soon all code will be generated instead of written. That programmers simply won’t be needed because business people will generate programs from specifications.</p><p>Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them <span class="emphasis"><em>is programming</em></span>. Such a specification <span class="emphasis"><em>is code</em></span>.</p><p>I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages will continue to increase. I also expect that the number of domain-specific languages will continue to grow. This will be a good thing. But it will not eliminate code. Indeed, all the specifications written in these higher level and domain-specific language will <span class="emphasis"><em>be</em></span> code! It will still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a machine can understand and execute it.</p><p>The folks who think that code will one day disappear are like mathematicians who hope one day to discover a mathematics that does not have to be formal. They are hoping that one day we will discover a way to create machines that can do what we want rather than what we say. These machines will have to be able to understand us so well that they can translate vaguely specified needs into perfectly executing programs that precisely meet those needs.</p><p>This will never happen. Not even humans, with all their intuition and creativity, have been able to create successful systems from the vague feelings of their customers. Indeed, if the discipline of requirements specification has taught us anything, it is that well-specified requirements are as formal as code and can act as executable tests of that code!</p><p>Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lev1sec2"></a>Bad Code</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1092" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1104" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1209" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1446" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1668" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1823" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1824" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2415" class="indexterm"></a>I was recently reading the preface to Kent Beck’s book <span class="emphasis"><em>Implementation Patterns</em></span>.<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/ch01.html#ftn.ch01fn01" class="footnote" id="ch01fn01"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> He says, “. . . this book is based on a rather fragile premise: that good code matters. . . .” A <span class="emphasis"><em>fragile</em></span> premise?

We know good code matters because we’ve had to deal for so long with its lack.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="f003fig01"></a><img src="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-2fig_martin.jpg" width="300" alt="Bad Code" height="438" data-mfp-src="/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-2fig_martin.jpg"></div><p>I know of one company that, in the late 80s, wrote a <span class="emphasis"><em>killer</em></span> app. It was very popular, and lots of professionals bought and used it. But then the release cycles began to stretch. Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next. Load times grew and crashes increased. I remember the day I shut the product down in frustration and never used it again. The company went out of business a short time after that.</p><p>Two decades later I met one of the early employees of that company and asked him what had happened. The answer confirmed my fears. They had rushed the product to market and had made a huge mess in the code. As they added more and more features, the code got worse and worse until they simply could not manage it any longer. <span class="emphasis"><em>It was the bad code that brought the company down.</em></span></p><p>Have <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> ever been significantly impeded by bad code? If you are a programmer of any experience then you’ve felt this impediment many times. Indeed, we have a name for it. We call it <span class="emphasis"><em>wading</em></span>. We wade through bad code. We slog through a morass of tangled brambles and hidden pitfalls. We struggle to find our way, hoping for some hint, some clue, of what is going on; but all we see is more and more senseless code.</p><p>Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then—why did you write it?</p><p>Were you trying to go fast? Were you in a rush? Probably so. Perhaps you felt that you didn’t have time to do a good job; that your boss would be angry with you if you took the time to clean up your code. Perhaps you were just tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over. Or maybe you looked at the backlog of other stuff that you had promised to get done and realized that you needed to slam this module together so you could move on to the next. We’ve all done it.</p><p>We’ve all looked at the mess we’ve just made and then have chosen to leave it for another day. We’ve all felt the relief of seeing our messy program work and deciding that a <a id="iddle1093" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1447" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1777" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1825" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2020" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2254" class="indexterm"></a>working mess is better than nothing. We’ve all said we’d go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn’t know LeBlanc’s law: <span class="emphasis"><em>Later equals never</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lev1sec3"></a>The Total Cost of Owning a Mess</h1></div></div></div><p>If you have been a programmer for more than two or three years, you have probably been significantly slowed down by someone else’s messy code. If you have been a programmer for longer than two or three years, you have probably been slowed down by messy code. The degree of the slowdown can be significant. Over the span of a year or two, teams that were moving very fast at the beginning of a project can find themselves moving at a snail’s pace. Every change they make to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code. No change is trivial. Every addition or modification to the system requires that the tangles, twists, and knots be “understood” so that more tangles, twists, and knots can be added. Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. There is no way at all.</p><p>As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero. As productivity decreases, management does the only thing they can; they add more staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity. But that new staff is not versed in the design of the system. They don’t know the difference between a change that matches the design intent and a change that thwarts the design intent. Furthermore, they, and everyone else on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase productivity. So they all make more and more messes, driving the productivity ever further toward zero. (See <a class="link" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/ch01.html#ch01fig01">Figure 1-1</a>.)</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch01fig01"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-4fig_martin.jpg" height="191" alt="Productivity vs. time" width="450" data-mfp-src="/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-4fig_martin.jpg"></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure&nbsp;1-1.&nbsp;Productivity vs. time</strong></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lev2sec1"></a>The Grand Redesign in the Sky</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1632" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2025" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2026" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2052" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2348" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2385" class="indexterm"></a>Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot continue to develop in this odious code base. They demand a redesign. Management does not want to expend the resources on a whole new redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity is terrible. Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the grand redesign in the sky.</p><p>A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it’s a green-field project. They get to start over and create something truly beautiful. But only the best and brightest are chosen for the tiger team. Everyone else must continue to maintain the current system.</p><p>Now the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system that does everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to keep up with the changes that are continuously being made to the old system. Management will not replace the old system until the new system can do everything that the old system does.</p><p>This race can go on for a very long time. I’ve seen it take 10 years. And by the time it’s done, the original members of the tiger team are long gone, and the current members are demanding that the new system be redesigned because it’s such a mess.</p><p>If you have experienced even one small part of the story I just told, then you already know that spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lev2sec2"></a>Attitude</h2></div></div></div><p>Have you ever waded through a mess so grave that it took weeks to do what should have taken hours? Have you seen what should have been a one-line change, made instead in hundreds of different modules? These symptoms are all too common.</p><p>Why does this happen to code? Why does good code rot so quickly into bad code? We have lots of explanations for it. We complain that the requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design. We bemoan the schedules that were too tight to do things right. We blather about stupid managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types and telephone sanitizers. But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. We are unprofessional.</p><p>This may be a bitter pill to swallow. How could this mess be <span class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> fault? What about the requirements? What about the schedule? What about the stupid managers and the useless marketing types? Don’t they bear some of the blame?</p><p>No. The managers and marketers look to <span class="emphasis"><em>us</em></span> for the information they need to make promises and commitments; and even when they don’t look to us, we should not be shy about telling them what we think. The users look to us to validate the way the requirements will fit into the system. The project managers look to us to help work out the schedule. We <a id="iddle1074" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1184" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1186" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1188" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1235" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1811" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2024" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2350" class="indexterm"></a>are deeply complicit in the planning of the project and share a great deal of the responsibility for any failures; especially if those failures have to do with bad code!</p><p>“But wait!” you say. “If I don’t do what my manager says, I’ll be fired.” Probably not. Most managers want the truth, even when they don’t act like it. Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. It’s <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> job to defend the code with equal passion.</p><p>To drive this point home, what if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time?<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/ch01.html#ftn.ch01fn02" class="footnote" id="ch01fn02"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a> Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to comply with the patient.</p><p>So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lev2sec3"></a>The Primal Conundrum</h2></div></div></div><p>Programmers face a conundrum of basic values. All developers with more than a few years experience know that previous messes slow them down. And yet all developers feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet deadlines. In short, they don’t take the time to go fast!</p><p>True professionals know that the second part of the conundrum is wrong. You will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> make the deadline by making the mess. Indeed, the mess will slow you down instantly, and will force you to miss the deadline. The <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lev2sec4"></a>The Art of Clean Code?</h2></div></div></div><p>Let’s say you believe that messy code is a significant impediment. Let’s say that you accept that the only way to go fast is to keep your code clean. Then you must ask yourself: “How do I write clean code?” It’s no good trying to write clean code if you don’t know what it means for code to be clean!</p><p>The bad news is that writing clean code is a lot like painting a picture. Most of us know when a picture is painted well or badly. But being able to recognize good art from bad does not mean that we know how to paint. So too being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code!</p><p><a id="iddle1144" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1185" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1236" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1476" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1481" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1721" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1975" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2213" class="indexterm"></a>Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of “cleanliness.” This “code-sense” is the key. Some of us are born with it. Some of us have to fight to acquire it. Not only does it let us see whether code is good or bad, but it also shows us the strategy for applying our discipline to transform bad code into clean code.</p><p>A programmer without “code-sense” can look at a messy module and recognize the mess but will have no idea what to do about it. A programmer <span class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span> “code-sense” will look at a messy module and see options and variations. The “code-sense” will help that programmer choose the best variation and guide him or her to plot a sequence of behavior preserving transformations to get from here to there.</p><p>In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lev2sec5"></a>What Is Clean Code?</h2></div></div></div><p>There are probably as many definitions as there are programmers. So I asked some very well-known and deeply experienced programmers what they thought.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of <span class="emphasis"><em>The C++ Programming Language</em></span></strong></span></p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="f007fig01"></a><img src="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-5fig_martin.jpg" width="300" alt="What Is Clean Code?" height="344" data-mfp-src="/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-5fig_martin.jpg"></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="italic">I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.</span></p></blockquote></div><p>Bjarne uses the word “elegant.” That’s quite a word! The dictionary in my MacBook<sup>®</sup> provides the following definitions: <span class="emphasis"><em>pleasingly graceful and stylish in appearance or manner; pleasingly ingenious and simple.</em></span> Notice the emphasis on the word “pleasing.” Apparently Bjarne thinks that clean code is <span class="emphasis"><em>pleasing</em></span> to read. Reading it should make you smile the way a well-crafted music box or well-designed car would.</p><p>Bjarne also mentions efficiency—<span class="emphasis"><em>twice</em></span>. Perhaps this should not surprise us coming from the inventor of C++; but I think there’s more to it than the sheer desire for speed. Wasted cycles are inelegant, they are not pleasing. And now note the word that Bjarne uses <a id="iddle1115" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1136" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1371" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1440" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1506" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1566" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1655" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1913" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2043" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2047" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2321" class="indexterm"></a>to describe the consequence of that inelegance. He uses the word “tempt.” There is a deep truth here. Bad code <span class="emphasis"><em>tempts</em></span> the mess to grow! When others change bad code, they tend to make it worse.</p><p>Pragmatic Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt said this a different way. They used the metaphor of broken windows.<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/ch01.html#ftn.ch01fn03" class="footnote" id="ch01fn03"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a> A building with broken windows looks like nobody cares about it. So other people stop caring. They allow more windows to become broken. Eventually they actively break them. They despoil the facade with graffiti and allow garbage to collect. One broken window starts the process toward decay.</p><p>Bjarne also mentions that error handing should be complete. This goes to the discipline of paying attention to details. Abbreviated error handling is just one way that programmers gloss over details. Memory leaks are another, race conditions still another. Inconsistent naming yet another. The upshot is that clean code exhibits close attention to detail.</p><p>Bjarne closes with the assertion that clean code does one thing well. It is no accident that there are so many principles of software design that can be boiled down to this simple admonition. Writer after writer has tried to communicate this thought. Bad code tries to do too much, it has muddled intent and ambiguity of purpose. Clean code is <span class="emphasis"><em>focused</em></span>. Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Grady Booch, author of <span class="emphasis"><em>Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications</em></span></strong></span></p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="f008fig01"></a><img src="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-6fig_martin.jpg" width="300" alt="What Is Clean Code?" height="277" data-mfp-src="/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/graphics/1-6fig_martin.jpg"></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="italic">Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.</span></p></blockquote></div><p>Grady makes some of the same points as Bjarne, but he takes a <span class="emphasis"><em>readability</em></span> perspective. I especially like his view that clean code should read like well-written prose. Think back on a really good book that you’ve read. Remember how the words disappeared to be replaced by images! It was like watching a movie, wasn’t it? Better! You saw the characters, you heard the sounds, you experienced the pathos and the humor.</p><p>Reading clean code will never be quite like reading <span class="emphasis"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></span>. Still, the literary metaphor is not a bad one. Like a good novel, clean code should clearly expose the tensions in the problem to be solved. It should build those tensions to a climax and then give <a id="iddle1189" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1788" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1789" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1837" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2041" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2250" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2290" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2322" class="indexterm"></a>the reader that “Aha! Of course!” as the issues and tensions are resolved in the revelation of an obvious solution.</p><p>I find Grady’s use of the phrase “crisp abstraction” to be a fascinating oxymoron! After all the word “crisp” is nearly a synonym for “concrete.” My MacBook’s dictionary holds the following definition of “crisp”: <span class="emphasis"><em>briskly decisive and matter-of-fact, without hesitation or unnecessary detail.</em></span> Despite this seeming juxtaposition of meaning, the words carry a powerful message. Our code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to speculative. It should contain only what is necessary.

It pays to consider his words carefully.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="italic">In recent years I begin, and nearly end, with Beck’s rules of simple code. In priority order, simple code:</span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Runs all the tests;</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Contains no duplication;</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.</span></p></li></ul></div><p><span class="italic">Of these, I focus mostly on duplication. When the same thing is done over and over, it’s a sign that there is an idea in our mind that is not well represented in the code. I try to figure out what it is. Then I try to express that idea more clearly.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Expressiveness to me includes meaningful names, and I am likely to change the names of things several times before I settle in. With modern coding tools such as Eclipse, renaming is quite inexpensive, so it doesn’t trouble me to change. Expressiveness goes <a id="iddle1023" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1373" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1539" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1667" class="indexterm"></a>beyond names, however. I also look at whether an object or method is doing more than one thing. If it’s an object, it probably needs to be broken into two or more objects. If it’s a method, I will always use the Extract Method refactoring on it, resulting in one method that says more clearly what it does, and some submethods saying how it is done.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Duplication and expressiveness take me a very long way into what I consider clean code, and improving dirty code with just these two things in mind can make a huge difference. There is, however, one other thing that I’m aware of doing, which is a bit harder to explain.</span></p><p><span class="italic">After years of doing this work, it seems to me that all programs are made up of very similar elements. One example is “find things in a collection.” Whether we have a database of employee records, or a hash map of keys and values, or an array of items of some kind, we often find ourselves wanting a particular item from that collection. When I find that happening, I will often wrap the particular implementation in a more abstract method or class. That gives me a couple of interesting advantages.</span></p><p><span class="italic">I can implement the functionality now with something simple, say a hash map, but since now all the references to that search are covered by my little abstraction, I can change the implementation any time I want. I can go forward quickly while preserving my ability to change later.</span></p><p><span class="italic">In addition, the collection abstraction often calls my attention to what’s “really” going on, and keeps me from running down the path of implementing arbitrary collection behavior when all I really need is a few fairly simple ways of finding what I want.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple abstractions. That’s what makes clean code for me.</span></p></blockquote></div><p>Here, in a few short paragraphs, Ron has summarized the contents of this book.

You read it, nod your head, and then go on to the next topic. It sounds so reasonable, so obvious, that it barely registers as something profound. You might think it was pretty much what you expected.

Isn’t it more likely that the modules you look at will be puzzling, complicated, tangled? Isn’t misdirection the rule? Aren’t you used to flailing about trying to grab and hold the threads of reasoning that spew forth from the whole system and weave their way through the module you are reading? When was the last time you read through some code and nodded your head the way you might have nodded your head at Ward’s statement?</p><p>Ward expects that when you read clean code you won’t be surprised at all. Indeed, you won’t even expend much effort. You will read it, and it will be pretty much what you expected. It will be obvious, simple, and compelling. Each module will set the stage for the next. Each tells you how the next will be written. Programs that are <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> clean are so profoundly well written that you don’t even notice it. The designer makes it look ridiculously simple like all exceptional designs.</p><p>And what about Ward’s notion of beauty? We’ve all railed against the fact that our languages weren’t designed for our problems. But Ward’s statement puts the onus back on us. He says that beautiful code <span class="emphasis"><em>makes the language look like it was made for the problem</em></span>! So it’s <span class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> responsibility to make the language look simple! Language bigots everywhere, beware! It is not the language that makes programs appear simple.

It would behoove you to learn from them as well.</p><p>Indeed, many of the recommendations in this book are controversial. You will probably not agree with all of them. You might violently disagree with some of them. That’s fine. We can’t claim final authority. On the other hand, the recommendations in this book are things that we have thought long and hard about.
