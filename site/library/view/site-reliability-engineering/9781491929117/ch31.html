effects on how we communicate and collaborate.</p>

<p>To begin with, there is a tremendous diversity in what SRE does, and
how we do it.  We have infrastructural teams, service teams, and
horizontal product teams. We have relationships with product
development teams ranging from teams that are many times our size, to
teams roughly the same size as their counterparts, and situations in
which we <em>are</em> the product development team. SRE teams are made up of
people with systems engineering or architectural skills (see
<a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/bibliography01.html#Hix15b">[Hix15b]</a>), software engineering skills, project management skills,
leadership instincts, backgrounds in all kinds of industries (see
<a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch33.html#chapter_other-reliability-efforts">Chapter&nbsp;33</a>), and so on.  We don’t have just
one model, and we have found a variety of configurations that work;
this flexibility suits our ultimately pragmatic nature.</p>

<p>It’s also true that SRE is not a command-and-control
organization. Generally, we owe allegiance to at least two masters:
for service or infrastructure SRE teams, we work closely with the
corresponding product development teams that work on those services or that
infrastructure; we also obviously work in the context of SRE
generally. The service relationship is very strong, since we are held
accountable for the performance of those systems, but despite that
relationship, our actual reporting lines are through SRE as a
whole. Today, we spend more time supporting our individual services
than on cross-production work, but our culture and our shared values
produce strongly homogeneous approaches to problems. This is by
design.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm140203535615472-marker" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch31.html#idm140203535615472">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The two preceding facts have steered the SRE organization in certain
directions when it comes to two crucial dimensions of how our teams
operate—communications and collaboration. Data flow would be an apt
computing metaphor for our communications: just like data must flow
around production, data also has to flow around an SRE team—data
about projects, the state of the services, production, and the state
of the individuals. For maximum effectiveness of a team, the data has
to flow in reliable ways from one interested party to another. One way
to think of this flow is to think of the interface that an SRE team
must present to other teams, such as an API. Just like an API, a good
design is crucial for effective operation, and if the API is
wrong, it can be painful to correct later on.</p>

<p>The API-as-contract metaphor is also relevant for collaboration, both among SRE teams, and between SRE and product development teams—all have to make progress in an environment of unrelenting change. To that extent, our
collaboration looks quite like collaboration in any other fast-moving
company. The difference is the mix of software engineering skills,
systems engineering expertise, and the wisdom of production experience that SRE
brings to bear on that collaboration.  The best designs and the best
implementations result from the joint concerns of production and the
product being met in an atmosphere of mutual respect. This is the
promise of SRE: an organization charged with reliability, with the
same skills as the product development teams, will improve things
measurably. Our experience suggests that simply having someone in
charge of reliability, without also having the complete skill set, is
not enough.</p>

<h1>Communications: Production Meetings</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="communication and collaboration" data-secondary="production meetings" data-see="production meetings" id="idm140203535609840"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="production meetings" id="CCproduct31"></a>Although literature about running effective meetings abounds
<a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/bibliography01.html#Kra08">[Kra08]</a>, it’s difficult to find someone who’s lucky enough to <em>only</em>
have useful, effective meetings. This is equally true for SRE.</p>

<p>However, there’s one kind of meeting that we have that is more useful
than the average, called a <em>production meeting</em>. Production meetings
are a special kind of meeting where an SRE team carefully articulates
to itself—and to its invitees—the state of the service(s) in
their charge, so as to increase general awareness among everyone who
cares, and to improve the operation of the service(s). In
general, these meetings are <em>service-oriented</em>; they are not directly
about the status updates of individuals. The goal is for everyone to
leave the meeting with an idea of what’s going on—the <em>same</em>
idea. The other major goal of production meetings is to improve our
services by bringing the wisdom of production to bear on our
services. That means we talk in detail about the operational
performance of the service, and relate that operational performance to
design, configuration, or implementation, and make recommendations for
how to fix the problems. Connecting the performance of the service
with design decisions in a regular meeting is an immensely powerful
feedback loop.</p>

<p>Our production meetings usually happen weekly; given SRE’s antipathy
to pointless meetings, this
frequency seems to be just about right: time to allow enough relevant
material to accumulate to make the meeting worthwhile, while not so
frequent that people find excuses to not attend. They usually last
somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes. Any less and you’re probably
cutting something unnecessarily short, or you should probably be
growing your service portfolio. Any more and you’re probably getting
mired in the detail, or you’ve got too much to talk about and you
should shard the team or service set.</p>

<p>Just like any other meeting, the production meeting should have a
chair. Many SRE teams rotate the chair through various team members,
which has the advantage of making everyone feel they have a stake in
the service and some notional ownership of the issues. It’s true that
not everyone has equal levels of chairing skill, but the value of
group ownership is so large that the trade-off of temporary
suboptimality is worthwhile. Furthermore, this is a chance to instill
chairing skills, which are very useful in the kind of incident
coordination situations commonly faced by SRE.</p>

<p>In cases where two SRE teams are meeting by video, and one of the teams
is much larger than the other, we have noticed an interesting dynamic
at play. We recommend placing your chair on the <em>smaller</em> side of the
call by default. The larger side naturally tends to quiet down and
some of the bad effects of imbalanced team sizes (made worse by the
delays inherent in video conferencing) will improve.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm140203535600000-marker" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch31.html#idm140203535600000">2</a></sup> We have no idea if this technique has any
scientific basis, but it does tend to work.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Agenda"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203535598928">
<h2>Agenda</h2>

<p>There are many ways to run a production meeting, attesting to the
diversity of what SRE looks after and how we do it. To that
extent, it’s not appropriate to be prescriptive on how to run one of
these meetings. However, a default agenda  (see
<a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/app06.html#appendix_effective-meetings">Appendix&nbsp;F</a> for an example) might look something like
the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Upcoming production changes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Change-tracking meetings are well known throughout the industry, and
indeed whole meetings have often been devoted to stopping
change. However, in our production environment, we usually default to
enabling change, which requires tracking the useful set of
properties of that change: start time, duration, expected effect, and
so on. This is near-term horizon visibility.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="pagebreak-before">
<dt>Metrics</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the major ways we conduct a service-oriented discussion is by
talking about the core metrics of the systems in question; see
<a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch04.html#chapter_sli-slo-sla">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>. Even if the systems didn’t dramatically fail
that week, it’s very common to be in a position where you’re looking
at gradually (or sharply!) increasing load throughout the
year. Keeping track of how your latency figures, CPU utilization
figures, etc., change over time is incredibly valuable for developing a
feeling for the performance envelope of a system.</p>

<p>Some teams track resource usage and efficiency, which is also a useful
indicator of slower, perhaps more insidious system changes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Outages</dt>
<dd>
<p>This item addresses problems of approximately postmortem size, and is
an indispensable opportunity for learning. A good postmortem analysis,
as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch15.html#chapter_postmortem-culture">Chapter&nbsp;15</a>, should always set the
juices flowing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Paging events</dt>
<dd>
<p>These are pages from your monitoring system, relating to problems
that <em>can</em> be postmortem worthy, but often aren’t. In any event,
while the Outages portion looks at the larger picture of an outage,
this section looks at the tactical view: the list of pages, who was
paged, what happened then, and so on.  There are two implicit
questions for this section: should that alert have paged in the way it
did, and should it have paged at all? If the answer to the last
question is no, remove those unactionable pages.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nonpaging events</dt>
<dd>
<p>This bucket contains three items:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>An issue that probably should have paged, but didn’t</em>. In these
cases, you should probably fix the monitoring so that such events do
trigger a page.  Often you encounter the issue while you’re trying to
fix something else, or it’s related to a metric you’re tracking but
for which you haven’t got an alert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>An issue that is not pageable but requires attention</em>, such as
low-impact data corruption or slowness in some non-user-facing
dimension of the system.  Tracking reactive operational work is also
appropriate here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>An issue that is not pageable and does not require attention</em>. These
alerts should be removed, because they create extra noise that distracts
engineers from issues that do merit attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="pagebreak-before">
<dt>Prior action items</dt>
<dd>
<p>The preceding detailed discussions often lead to actions that SRE needs to
take—fix this, monitor that, develop a subsystem to do the
other. Track these improvements just as they would be tracked in any
other meeting: assign action items to people and track their
progress. It’s a good idea to have an explicit agenda item that acts as
a catchall, if nothing else. Consistent delivery is also a wonderful
credibility and trust builder. It doesn’t matter how such delivery
is done, just that it <em>is</em> done.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Attendance"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203535576544">
<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>Attendance is compulsory for all the members of the SRE team in
question. This is particularly true if your team is spread across
multiple countries and/or time zones, because this is your major
opportunity to interact as a group.</p>

<p>The major stakeholders should also attend this meeting. Any partner
product development teams you may have should also attend. Some SRE
teams shard their meeting so SRE-only matters are kept to the first
half; that practice is fine, as long as everyone, as stated previously,
leaves with the same idea of what’s going on. From time to time
representatives from other SRE teams might turn up, particularly if
there’s some larger cross-team issue to discuss, but in general, the
SRE team in question plus major other teams should attend. If your
relationship is such that you cannot invite your product development
partners, you need to fix that relationship: perhaps the first step is
to invite a representative from that team, or to find a trusted
intermediary to proxy communication or model healthy
interactions. There are many reasons why teams don’t get along, and a
wealth of writing on how to solve that problem: this information is
also applicable to SRE teams, but it is important that the end goal of
having a feedback loop from operations is fulfilled, or a large part
of the value of having an SRE team is lost.</p>

<p>Occasionally you’ll have too many teams or busy-yet-crucial attendees
to invite. There are a number of techniques you can use to handle those
situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Less active services might be attended by a single representative
from the product development team, or only have commitment from the
product development team to read and comment on the agenda minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the production development team is quite large, nominate a
subset of representatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Busy-yet-crucial attendees can provide feedback and/or steering in
advance to individuals, or using the prefilled agenda technique
(described next).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Most of the meeting strategies we’ve discussed are common sense, with a service-oriented twist. One
unique spin on making meetings more efficient <em>and</em> more inclusive is
to use the real-time collaborative features of Google Docs. Many SRE
teams have such a doc, with a well-known address that anyone in
engineering can access. Having such a doc enables two great practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Pre-populating the agenda with “bottom up” ideas, comments, and
information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparing the agenda in parallel <em>and</em> in advance is really
efficient.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Fully use the multiple-person collaboration features enabled by the
   product.  There’s nothing quite like seeing a meeting chair type in
   a sentence, then seeing someone else supply a link to the source
   material in brackets after they have finished typing, and then
   seeing yet another person tidy up the spelling and grammar in the
   original sentence. Such collaboration gets stuff done faster, and
   makes more people feel like they own a slice of what the team does.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="CCproduct31" id="idm140203535564144"></a></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Collaboration within SRE"><div class="sect1" id="idm140203535562720">
<h1>Collaboration within SRE</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="communication and collaboration" data-secondary="within SRE team" id="idm140203535561568"></a>Obviously, Google is a multinational organization. Because of the emergency
response and pager rotation component of our role, we have very good business
reasons to be a distributed organization, separated by at least a few
time zones. The practical impact of this distribution is that we have very fluid
definitions for “team” compared to, for example, the average product
development team. We have local teams, the team on the site, the
cross-continental team, virtual teams of various sizes and coherence, and everything
in between. This creates a cheerfully chaotic mix of responsibilities, skills,
and opportunities. Much of the same dynamics could be expected to pertain to
any sufficiently large company (although they might be particularly intense for
tech companies). Given that most local collaboration faces no particular
obstacle, the interesting case collaboration-wise is cross-team, cross-site,
across a virtual team, and similar.</p>

<p>This pattern of distribution also informs how SRE teams tend to be
organized.  Because our <em>raison d’être</em> is bringing value through
technical mastery, and technical mastery tends to be hard, we
therefore try to find a way to have mastery over some related subset
of systems or infrastructures, in order to decrease cognitive
load. Specialization is one way of accomplishing this objective;
i.e., team X works only on product Y. Specialization is good, because
it leads to higher chances of improved technical mastery, but it’s
also bad, because it leads to siloization and ignorance of the broader
picture. We try to have a crisp team charter to define what a team
will—and more importantly, won’t—support, but we don’t always succeed.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Team Composition"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203535557760">
<h2>Team Composition</h2>

<p>We have a wide array of skill sets in SRE, ranging from systems
engineering through software engineering, and into organization and
management. The one thing we can say about collaboration is that your
chances of successful collaboration—and indeed just about anything
else—are improved by having more diversity in your team. There’s a lot
of evidence suggesting that diverse teams are simply better teams <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/bibliography01.html#Nel14">[Nel14]</a>.
Running a diverse team implies particular attention to
communication, cognitive biases, and so on, which we can’t cover in
detail here.</p>

<p>Formally, SRE teams have the roles of “tech lead” (TL), “manager”
(SRM), and “project manager” (also known as PM, TPM, PgM). Some people
operate best when those roles have well-defined responsibilities: the
major benefit of this being they can make in-scope decisions
quickly and safely.  Others operate best in a more fluid environment,
with shifting responsibilities depending on dynamic negotiation. In
general, the more fluid the team is, the more developed it is in terms
of the capabilities of the individuals, and the more able the team is
to adapt to new situations—but at the cost of having to communicate
more and more often, because less background can be assumed.</p>

<p>Regardless of how well these roles are defined, at a base level the
tech lead is responsible for technical direction in the team, and can
lead in a variety of ways—everything from carefully commenting on
everyone’s code, to holding quarterly direction presentations, to building
consensus in the team. In Google, TLs can do almost all of a manager’s
job, because our managers are highly technical, but the manager has
two special responsibilities that a TL doesn’t have: the performance
management function, and being a general catchall for everything
that isn’t handled by someone else. Great TLs, SRMs, and TPMs have a
complete set of skills and can cheerfully turn their hand to
organizing a project, commenting on a design doc, or writing code as
necessary.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Working Effectively</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways to engineer effectively in SRE.</p>

<p>In general, singleton projects fail unless the person is particularly
gifted or the problem is straightforward. To accomplish anything
significant, you pretty much need multiple people. Therefore, you also
need good collaboration skills.  Again, lots of material has been
written on this topic, and much of this literature is applicable to
SRE.</p>

<p>In general, good SRE work calls for excellent communication skills
when you’re working outside the boundary of your purely local
team. For collaborations outside the building, effectively working
across time zones implies either great written communication, or lots
of travel to supply the in-person experience that is deferrable but
ultimately necessary for a high-quality relationship.  Even if you’re
a great writer, over time you decay into just being an email address
until you turn up in the flesh again.</p>

<h1>Case Study of Collaboration in SRE: Viceroy</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="communication and collaboration" data-secondary="case studies" id="CCviceroy31"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Viceroy project" id="viceroy31"></a>One example of a successful cross-SRE collaboration is a project called
Viceroy, which is a monitoring dashboard framework and service. The current
organizational architecture of SRE can end up with teams producing multiple,
slightly different copies of the same piece of work; for various reasons,
monitoring dashboard frameworks were a particularly fertile ground for
duplication of work.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm140203535545024-marker" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch31.html#idm140203535545024">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The incentives that led to the serious litter problem of many smoldering, abandoned hulks
of monitoring frameworks lying around were pretty simple: each
team was rewarded for developing its own solution, working outside of
the team boundary was hard, and the infrastructure that tended to be
provided SRE-wide was typically closer to a toolkit than a
product. This environment encouraged individual engineers to use the
toolkit to make another burning wreck rather than fix the problem for
the largest number of people possible (an effort that would therefore
take much longer).</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="The Coming of the Viceroy"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203535543232">
<h2>The Coming of the Viceroy</h2>

<p>Viceroy was different. It began in 2012 when a number of teams were
considering how to move to Monarch, the new monitoring system at
Google. SRE is deeply conservative with respect to monitoring systems,
so Monarch somewhat ironically took a longer while to get traction
within SRE than within non-SRE teams. But no one could argue that our
legacy monitoring system, Borgmon (see <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch10.html#chapter_borgmon">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>), had no
room for improvement. For example, our consoles were cumbersome
because they used a custom HTML templating system that was
special-cased, full of funky edge cases, and difficult to test. At
that time, Monarch had matured enough to be accepted in principle as
the replacement for the legacy system and was therefore being adopted
by more and more teams across Google, but it turned out we still had a
problem with consoles.</p>

<p>Those of us who tried using Monarch for our services soon found that
it fell short in its console support for two main reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consoles were easy to set up for a small service, but didn’t scale
well to services with complex consoles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They also didn’t support the legacy monitoring system, making the
transition to Monarch very difficult.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Because no viable alternative to deploying Monarch in this way existed at the time, a
number of team-specific projects launched. Since there was little
enough in the way of coordinated development solutions or even
cross-group tracking at the time (a problem that has since been
fixed), we ended up duplicating efforts yet again.  Multiple teams
from Spanner, Ads Frontend, and a variety of other services spun up
their own efforts (one notable example was called
Consoles++) over the course of 12–18 months, and eventually
sanity prevailed when engineers from all those teams woke up and
discovered each other’s respective efforts. They decided to do the
sensible thing and join forces in order to create a general solution
for all of SRE. Thus, the Viceroy project was born in mid
2012.</p>

<p>By the beginning of 2013, Viceroy had started to gather interest from
teams who had yet to move off the legacy system, but who were looking
to put a toe in the water. Obviously, teams with larger existing
monitoring projects had fewer incentives to move to the new system: it
was hard for these teams to rationalize jettisoning the low
maintenance cost for their existing solution that basically worked
fine, for something relatively new and unproven that would require
lots of effort to make work. The sheer diversity of requirements added
to the reluctance of these teams, even though all monitoring console
projects shared two main requirements, notably:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Support complex curated dashboards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support both Monarch and the legacy monitoring system</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project <em>also</em> had its own set of technical requirements, which
depended on the author’s preference or experience. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Multiple data sources outside the core monitoring systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of consoles using configuration versus explicit HTML layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No JavaScript versus full embrace of JavaScript with AJAX</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sole use of static content, so the consoles can be cached in the
browser</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Although some of these requirements were stickier than others, overall
they made merging efforts difficult. Indeed, although the
Consoles++ team was interested in seeing how their project
compared to Viceroy, their initial examination in the first half of
2013 determined that the fundamental differences between the two
projects were significant enough to prevent integration. The largest
difficulty was that Viceroy by design did not use much JavaScript,
while Consoles++ was mostly written in JavaScript. There was a
glimmer of hope, however, in that the two systems did have a number of
underlying similarities:</p>

<ul class="pagebreak-before">
<li>
<p>They used similar syntaxes for HTML template rendering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They shared a number of long-term goals, which neither team had
yet begun to address. For example, both systems wanted to cache
monitoring data and support an offline pipeline to periodically
produce data that the console can use, but was too computationally
expensive to produce on demand.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We ended up parking the unified console discussion for a
while. However, by the end of 2013, both Consoles++ and Viceroy
had developed significantly. Their technical differences had narrowed,
because Viceroy had started using JavaScript to render its monitoring
graphs. The two teams met and figured out that integration was a lot
easier, now that integration boiled down to serving the
Consoles++ data out of the Viceroy server. The first integrated
prototypes were completed in early 2014, and proved that the systems
could work well together.  Both teams felt comfortable committing to a
joint effort at that point, and because Viceroy had already established
its brand as a common monitoring solution, the combined project
retained the Viceroy name. Developing full functionality took a few
quarters, but by the end of 2014, the combined system was complete.</p>

<p>Joining forces reaped huge benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Viceroy received a host of data sources and the JavaScript clients
to access them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript compilation was rewritten to support separate modules
that can be selectively included. This is essential to scale the
system to any number of teams with their own JavaScript code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consoles++ benefited from the many improvements actively
being made to Viceroy, such as the addition of its cache and
background data pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, the development velocity on <em>one</em> solution was much larger
than the sum of all the development velocity of the duplicative
projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the common future vision was the key factor in combining
the projects. Both teams found value in expanding their development
team and benefited from each other’s contributions. The momentum was
such that, by the end of 2014, Viceroy was officially declared the
general monitoring solution for all of SRE. Perhaps characteristically
for Google, this declaration didn’t require that teams adopt Viceroy:
rather, it recommended that teams should use Viceroy instead of
writing another monitoring console.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Challenges"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203535515648">
<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>While ultimately a success, Viceroy was not without difficulties, and
many of those arose due to the cross-site nature of the project.</p>

<p>Once the extended Viceroy team was established, initial coordination
among remote team members proved difficult. When meeting people for
the first time, subtle cues in writing and speaking can be
misinterpreted, because communication styles vary substantially from person
to person. At the start of the project, team members who weren’t
located in Mountain View also missed out on the impromptu water cooler
discussions that often happened shortly before and after meetings
(although communication has since improved considerably).</p>

<p>While the core Viceroy team remained fairly consistent, the extended
team of contributors was fairly dynamic. Contributors had other
responsibilities that changed over time, and therefore many were able
to dedicate between one and three months to the project. Thus, the
developer contributor pool, which was inherently larger than the core
Viceroy team, was characterized by a significant amount of churn.</p>

<p>Adding new people to the project required training each contributor on
the overall design and structure of the system, which took some
time. On the other hand, when an SRE contributed to the core
functionality of Viceroy and later returned to their own team, they
were a local expert on the system. That unanticipated dissemination of
local Viceroy experts drove more usage and adoption.</p>

<p>As people joined and left the team, we found that casual contributions
were both useful and costly. The primary cost was the dilution of
ownership: once features were delivered and the person left, the
features became unsupported over time, and were generally dropped.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the scope of the Viceroy project grew over time. It had
ambitious goals at launch but the initial <em>scope</em> was limited. As the
scope grew, however, we struggled to deliver core features on time,
and had to improve project management and set clearer direction to
ensure the project stayed on track.</p>

<p>Finally, the Viceroy team found it difficult to completely own a
component that had significant (determining) contributions from
distributed sites. Even with the best will in the world, people
generally default to the path of least resistance and discuss issues
or make decisions locally without involving the remote owners, which
can lead to conflict.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Recommendations"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203535508656">
<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>You should only develop projects cross-site when you have to, but often there are
good reasons to have to. The cost of working across sites is higher
latency for actions and more communication being required; the benefit
is—if you get the mechanics right—much higher throughput. The
single site project can also fall foul of no one outside of that site
knowing what you’re doing, so there are costs to both
approaches.</p>

<p>Motivated contributors are valuable, but not all contributions are
equally valuable. Make sure project contributors are actually
committed, and aren’t just joining with some nebulous
self-actualization goal (wanting to earn a notch on their belt
attaching their name to a shiny project; wanting to code on a new
exciting project without committing to maintaining that project).
Contributors with a specific goal to achieve
will generally be better motivated and will better maintain their
contributions.</p>

<p>As projects develop, they usually grow, and you’re not always in the
lucky position of having people in your local team to contribute to
the project.  Therefore, think carefully about the project
structure. The project leaders are important: they provide long-term
vision for the project and make sure all work aligns with that vision
and is prioritized correctly. You also need to have an agreed way of
making decisions, and should specifically optimize for making more
decisions locally if there is a high level of agreement and trust.</p>

<p>The standard “divide and conquer” strategy applies to cross-site
projects; you reduce communication costs primarily by splitting the
project into as many reasonably sized components as possible, and
trying to make sure that each component can be assigned to a small
group, preferably within one site. Divide these components among the
project subteams, and establish clear deliverables and deadlines. (Try
not to let Conway’s law distort the natural shape of the software too
deeply.)<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm140203535504096-marker" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch31.html#idm140203535504096">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A goal for a project team works best when it’s oriented toward
providing some functionality or solving some problem. This approach
ensures that the individuals working on a component know what is
expected of them, and that their work is only complete once that
component is fully integrated and used within the main project.</p>

<p>Obviously, the usual engineering best practices apply to collaborative
projects: each component should have design documents and reviews with
the team. In this way, everyone in the team is given the opportunity
to stay abreast of changes, in addition to the chance to influence and
improve designs.  Writing things down is one of the major techniques
you have to offset physical and/or logical distance—use it.</p>

<p>Standards are important. Coding style guidelines are a good start, but
they’re usually quite tactical and therefore only a starting point for
establishing team norms. Every time there is a debate around which
choice to make on an issue, argue it out fully with the team but with
a strict time limit. Then pick a solution, document it, and move
on. If you can’t agree, you need to pick some arbitrator that everyone
respects, and again just move forward. Over time you’ll build up a
collection of these best practices, which will help new people come up
to speed.</p>

<p>Ultimately, there’s no substitute for in-person interaction, although
some portion of face-to-face interaction can be deferred by good use
of VC and good written communication. If you can, have the leaders of
the project meet the rest of the team in person. If time and budget
allows, organize a team summit so that all members of the team can
interact in person. A summit also provides a great opportunity to hash
out designs and goals. For situations where neutrality is important,
it’s advantageous to hold team summits at a neutral location so that no individual site
has the “home advantage.”</p>

<p>Finally, use the project management style that suits the project in
its current state. Even projects with ambitious goals will start out
small, so the overhead should be correspondingly low. As the project
grows, it’s appropriate to adapt and change how the project is
managed. Given sufficient growth, full project management will be

collaboration between the product development organization and SRE is
really at its best when it occurs early on in the design phase,
ideally before any line of code has been committed. SREs are best
placed to make recommendations about architecture and software
behavior that can be quite difficult (if not impossible) to
retrofit. Having that voice present in the room when a new system is
being designed goes better for everyone. Broadly speaking, we use the Objectives &amp; Key Results (OKR) process <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/bibliography01.html#Kla12">[Kla12]</a> to track such work.

collaboration is the mainstay of what they do—tracking new designs,
making recommendations, helping to implement them, and seeing those
through to production.</p>

<h1>Case Study: Migrating DFP to F1</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP)" id="dfp31"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="MySQL" data-secondary="migrating" id="idm140203535488624"></a>Large migration projects of existing services are quite common at
Google. Typical examples include porting service components to a new
technology or updating components to support a new data format. With
the recent introduction of database technologies that can scale to a

undertaken a number of large-scale migration projects involving
databases. One such project was the migration of the main database of
DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP)<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm140203535485408-marker" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch31.html#idm140203535485408">5</a></sup> from MySQL to F1. In particular, some of this chapter’s
authors were in charge of a portion of the serving system
(shown in <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch31.html#fig_comms-collab_ads-serving">Figure&nbsp;31-1</a>) that continually extracts
and processes data from the database, in order to generate a set of
indexed files that are then loaded and served around the world. This
system was distributed over several datacenters and
used about 1,000 CPUs and 8 TB of RAM to index 100 TB of data every day.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 31-1. </span>A generic ads serving system</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The migration was nontrivial: in addition to migrating to a new
technology, the database schema was significantly refactored and
simplified thanks to the ability of F1 to store and index protocol
buffer data in table columns. The goal was to migrate the processing
system so that it could produce an output perfectly identical to the
existing system. This allowed us to leave the serving system untouched
and to perform, from the user’s perspective, a seamless migration. As
an added restriction, the product required that we complete a live
migration without any disruption of the service to our users at any
time. In order to achieve this, the product
development team and the SRE team started working closely, from the
very beginning, to develop the new indexing service.</p>

<p>As its main developers, product development teams are typically more
familiar with the Business Logic (BL) of the software, and are also in
closer contact with the Product Managers and the actual “business
need” component of products. On the other hand, SRE teams usually have
more expertise pertaining to the infrastructure components of the
software (e.g., libraries to talk to distributed storage systems or
databases), because SREs often reuse the same building blocks across
different services, learning the many caveats and nuances that allow
the software to run scalably and reliably over time.</p>

<p>From the start of the migration project, product development and SRE
knew they would have to collaborate even more closely, conducting
weekly meetings to sync on the project’s progress. In this particular
case the BL changes were partially dependent upon infrastructure
changes. For this reason the project started with the design of the
new infrastructure; the SREs, who had extensive knowledge about the
domain of extracting and processing data at scale, drove the design of
the infrastructure changes. This involved designing how to extract the
various tables from F1, how to filter and join the data, how to
extract only the data that changed (as opposed to the entire
database), how to sustain the loss of some of the machines without
impacting the service, how to ensure that the resource usage grows
linearly with the amount of extracted data, the capacity planning, and
many other similar aspects. The new proposed infrastructure was
similar to other services that were already extracting and processing
data from F1. Therefore, we could be sure of the soundness of the
solution and reuse parts of the monitoring and tooling.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the development of this new infrastructure, two
SREs produced a detailed design document. Then, both the product
development and SRE teams thoroughly reviewed the document, tweaking
the solution to handle some edge cases, and eventually agreed on a
design plan. Such a plan clearly identified what kind of changes the new
infrastructure would bring to the BL. For example, we designed the new
infrastructure to extract only changed data, instead of
repeatedly extracting the entire database; the BL had to take into
account this new approach. Early on, we
defined the new interfaces between infrastructure and BL, and
doing so allowed the product development team
to work independently on the BL changes. Similarly, the product
development team kept SRE informed of BL changes. Where they
interacted (e.g., BL changes dependent on infrastructure), this
coordination structure allowed us to know changes were happening,
and to handle them quickly and correctly.</p>

<p>In later phases of the project, SREs began deploying the new service
in a testing environment that resembled the project’s eventual
finished production environment. This step was essential to measure
the expected behavior of the service—in particular, performance and
resource utilization—while the development of BL was still
underway. The product development team used this testing environment
to perform validation of the new service: the index of the ads
produced by the old service (running in production) had to match
perfectly the index produced by the new service (running in the
testing environment). As suspected, the validation process highlighted
discrepancies between the old and new services (due to some edge
cases in the new data format), which the product development team was
able to resolve iteratively: for each ad they debugged the
cause of the difference and fixed the BL that produced the bad output.
In the meantime, the SRE team began preparing the production
environment: allocating the necessary resources in a different
datacenter, setting up processes and monitoring rules, and training
the engineers designated to be on-call for the service. The SRE
team also set up a basic release process that included validation, a
task usually completed by the product development
team or by Release Engineers but in this specific case was completed
by SREs to speed up the migration.</p>

<p>When the service was ready the SREs prepared a rollout plan in
collaboration with the product development team and launched the new
service. The launch was very successful and proceeded smoothly,
without any visible user impact.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="CCviceroy31" id="idm140203535473520"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="dfp31" id="idm140203535472576"></a></p>
