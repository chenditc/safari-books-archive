<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="Google's focus on" id="idm140203533906064"></a>Ask someone to name a Google software engineering effort and
they’ll likely list a consumer-facing product like Gmail or Maps;
some might even mention underlying infrastructure such as Bigtable or
Colossus. But in truth, there is a massive amount of behind-the-scenes
software engineering that consumers never see. A number of those
products are developed within SRE.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google production environment" data-secondary="complexity of" id="idm140203533904304"></a>Google’s production environment is—by some measures—one of the most complex machines humanity has ever built. SREs have firsthand experience with the intricacies of
production, making them uniquely well suited to develop the
appropriate tools to solve internal problems and use cases
related to keeping production running. The majority of these tools are
related to the overall directive of maintaining uptime and keeping
latency low, but take many forms: examples include binary rollout
mechanisms, monitoring, or a development environment built on dynamic
server composition. Overall, these SRE-developed tools are
full-fledged software engineering projects, distinct from one-off
solutions and quick hacks, and the SREs who develop them have adopted
a product-based mindset that takes both internal customers and a
roadmap for future plans into account.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why Is Software Engineering Within SRE Important?"><div class="sect1" id="idm140203533902176">
<h1>Why Is Software Engineering Within SRE Important?</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="importance of" id="idm140203533901008"></a>In many ways, the vast scale of Google production has necessitated
internal software development, because few third-party tools are designed
at sufficient scale for Google’s needs. The company’s history of
successful software projects has led us to appreciate the benefits of
developing directly within SRE.</p>

<p>SREs are in a unique position to effectively develop internal software
for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The breadth and depth of Google-specific production knowledge
within the SRE organization allows its engineers to design and create
software with the appropriate considerations for dimensions such as
scalability, graceful degradation during failure, and the ability to
easily interface with other infrastructure or tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because SREs are embedded in the subject matter, they easily
understand the needs and requirements of the tool being developed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A direct relationship with the intended user—fellow SREs—results
in frank and high-signal user feedback. Releasing a tool to an
internal audience with high familiarity with the problem space means
that a development team can launch and iterate more quickly. Internal
users are typically more understanding when it comes to minimal UI and
other alpha product issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From a purely pragmatic standpoint, Google clearly benefits from
having engineers with SRE experience developing software. By
deliberate design, the growth rate of SRE-supported services exceeds
the growth rate of the SRE organization; one of SRE’s guiding
principles is that “team size should not scale directly with service
growth.” Achieving linear team growth in the face of exponential
service growth requires perpetual automation work and efforts to
streamline tools, processes, and other aspects of a service that
introduce inefficiency into the day-to-day operation of production.
Having the people with direct experience running production systems
developing the tools that will ultimately contribute to uptime and
latency goals makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>On the flip side, individual SREs, as well as the broader SRE
organization, also benefit from SRE-driven software development.</p>

<p>Fully fledged software development projects within SRE provide career
development opportunities for SREs, as well as an outlet for engineers
who don’t want their coding skills to get rusty. Long-term project
work provides much-needed balance to interrupts and on-call work, and
can provide job satisfaction for engineers who want their careers to
maintain a balance between software engineering and systems
engineering.</p>

<p>Beyond the design of automation tools and other efforts to reduce the
workload for engineers in SRE, software development projects can
further benefit the SRE organization by attracting and helping to
retain engineers with a broad variety of skills. The desirability of
team diversity is doubly true for SRE, where a variety of backgrounds
and problem-solving approaches can help prevent blind spots. To this
end, Google always strives to staff its SRE teams with a mix of
engineers with traditional software development experience and
engineers with systems engineering experience.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="Auxon case study" id="SREauxon18"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Auxon case study" id="auxon18"></a>This case study examines Auxon, a powerful tool developed within SRE
to automate capacity planning for services running in Google
production. To best understand how Auxon was conceived and the
problems it addresses, we’ll first examine the problem space
associated with capacity planning, and the difficulties that
traditional approaches to this task present for services at Google and
across the industry as a whole. For more context on how Google uses the terms <em>service</em> and <em>cluster</em>, see <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch02.html#chapter_production-environment">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Traditional Capacity Planning"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203533885376">
<h2>Traditional Capacity Planning</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="capacity planning" data-secondary="traditional approach to" id="idm140203533884224"></a>There are myriad tactics for capacity planning
of compute resources (see <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/bibliography01.html#Hix15a">[Hix15a]</a>), but the majority of these approaches boil down
to a <em>cycle</em> that can be approximated as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1) Collect demand forecasts.</dt>
<dd>
<p>How many resources are needed? When and
where are these resources needed?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Uses the best data we have available today to plan into the future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically covers anywhere from several quarters to years</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2) Devise build and allocation plans.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given this forecasted outlook,
what’s the best way to meet this demand with additional supply of
resources? How much supply, and in what locations?</p>
</dd>
<dt>3) Review and sign off on plan.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Is the forecast reasonable? Does the
plan line up with budgetary, product-level, and technical
considerations?</p>
</dd>
<dt>4) Deploy and configure resources.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once resources eventually arrive
(potentially in phases over the course of some defined period of
time), which services get to use the resources?  How do I make
typically lower-level resources (CPU, disk, etc.) useful for services?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It bears stressing that capacity planning is a neverending <em>cycle</em>:
assumptions change, deployments slip, and budgets are cut, resulting
in revision upon revision of The Plan. And each revision has
trickle-down effects that must propagate throughout the plans of all
subsequent quarters. For example, a shortfall this quarter must be
made up in future quarters. Traditional capacity planning uses demand
as a key driver, and manually shapes supply to fit demand in response
to each change.</p>










<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Brittle by nature"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533871504">
<h3>Brittle by nature</h3>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="capacity planning" data-secondary="drawbacks of traditional plans" id="idm140203533870368"></a>Traditional capacity planning produces a resource allocation plan that
can be disrupted by any seemingly minor change. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A service undergoes a decrease in efficiency, and needs more
resources than expected to serve the same demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer adoption rates increase, resulting in an increase in
projected demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The delivery date for a new cluster of compute resources slips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A product decision about a performance goal changes the shape of the
required service deployment (the service’s footprint) and the amount of required <span class="keep-together">resources</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor changes require cross-checking the entire allocation plan to make
sure that the plan is still feasible; larger changes (such as delayed
resource delivery or product strategy changes) potentially require
re-creating the plan from scratch. A delivery slippage in a single
cluster might impact the redundancy or latency requirements of
multiple services: resource allocations in other clusters must be
increased to make up for the slippage, and these and any other changes
would have to propagate throughout the plan.</p>

<p>Also, consider that the capacity plan for any given quarter (or other
time frame) is based on the expected outcome of the capacity plans of
previous quarters, meaning that a change in any one quarter results in
work to update subsequent quarters.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Laborious and imprecise"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533862080">
<h3>Laborious and imprecise</h3>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="constraints" id="idm140203533860944"></a>For many teams, the process of collecting the data necessary to
generate demand forecasts is slow and error-prone. And when it is time
to find capacity to meet this future demand, not all resources are
equally suitable. For example, if latency requirements mean that a
service must commit to serve user demand on the same continent as the
user, obtaining additional resources in North America won’t alleviate
a capacity shortfall in Asia. Every forecast has <em>constraints</em>, or
parameters around how it can be fulfilled; constraints are
fundamentally related to intent, which is discussed in the next
section.</p>

<p>Mapping constrained resource requests into allocations of actual
resources from the available capacity is equally slow: it’s both
complex and tedious to bin pack requests into limited space by hand,
or to find solutions that fit a limited budget.</p>

<p>This process may already paint a grim picture, but to make matters
worse, the tools it requires are typically unreliable or cumbersome.
Spreadsheets suffer severely from scalability problems and have
limited error-checking abilities. Data becomes stale, and tracking
changes becomes difficult. Teams often are forced to make simplifying
assumptions and reduce the complexity of their requirements, simply to
render maintaining adequate capacity a tractable problem.</p>

<p>When service owners face the challenges of fitting a series of
requests for capacity from various services into the resources
available to them, in a manner that meets the various constraints a
service may have, additional imprecision ensues. Bin packing is an
NP-hard problem that is difficult for human beings to compute by hand.
Furthermore, the capacity request from a service is generally an
inflexible set of demand requirements: <em>X</em> cores in cluster <em>Y</em>. The
reasons why <em>X</em> cores or <em>Y</em> cluster are needed, and any degrees of
freedom around those parameters, are long lost by the time the request
reaches a human trying to fit a list of demands into available supply.</p>

<p>The net result is a massive expenditure of human effort to come up
with a bin packing that is approximate, at best. The process is
brittle to change, and there are no known bounds on an optimal
solution.</p>

<h2>Our Solution: Intent-Based Capacity Planning</h2>

<p><em>Specify the requirements, not the implementation.</em></p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="capacity planning" data-secondary="intent-based" data-see="intent-based capacity planning" id="idm140203533851792"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="intent-based capacity planning" id="SREintent18"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="basic premise of" id="idm140203533849312"></a>At Google, many teams have moved to an approach we call <em>Intent-based
Capacity Planning</em>. The basic premise of this approach is to
programmatically encode the dependencies and parameters (<em>intent</em>) of
a service’s needs, and use that encoding to autogenerate an
allocation plan that details which resources go to which service, in
which cluster. If demand, supply, or service requirements change, we
can simply autogenerate a new plan in response to the changed
parameters, which is now the new best distribution of resources.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="benefits of" id="idm140203533846544"></a>With a service’s true requirements and flexibility captured, the
capacity plan is now dramatically more nimble in the face of change,
and we can reach an optimal solution that meets as many parameters as
possible. With bin packing delegated to computers, human toil is
drastically reduced, and service owners can focus on high-order
priorities like SLOs, production dependencies, and service
infrastructure requirements, as opposed to low-level scrounging for
resources.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="computational optimization" id="idm140203533844672"></a>As an added benefit, using computational optimization to map from
intent to implementation achieves much greater precision, ultimately
resulting in cost savings to the organization. Bin packing is still
far from a solved problem, because certain types are still considered
NP-hard; however, today’s algorithms can solve to a known optimal
solution.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="SREauxon18" id="idm140203533843488"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="auxon18" id="idm140203533842544"></a></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Intent-Based Capacity Planning"><div class="sect1" id="idm140203533841120">
<h1>Intent-Based Capacity Planning</h1>

<p><em>Intent</em> <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="defined" id="idm140203533839520"></a>is the rationale for how a service owner wants to run their
service.  Moving from concrete resource demands to motivating reasons
in order to arrive at the true capacity planning intent often requires
several layers of abstraction. Consider the following chain of
abstraction:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1) “I want 50 cores in clusters X, Y, and Z for service Foo.”</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is an explicit resource request. But…<em>why do we need this many
resources specifically in these particular clusters?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>2) “I want a 50-core footprint in any 3 clusters in geographic region YYY for service Foo.”</dt>
<dd>
<p>This request introduces more degrees of freedom and is
potentially easier to fulfill, although it doesn’t explain the
reasoning behind its requirements. But…<em>why do we need this
quantity of resources, and why 3 footprints?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>3) <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="N + 2 configuration" id="nplus2"></a>“I want to meet service Foo’s demand in each geographic region, and have N + 2 <span class="keep-together">redundancy</span>.”</dt>
<dd>
<p>Suddenly greater flexibility is introduced and we can understand at a
more “human” level what happens if service Foo does not receive these
resources. But…<em>why do we need N + 2 for service Foo?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>4) “I want to run service Foo at 5 nines of reliability.”</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a more abstract
requirement, and the ramification if the requirement isn’t met
becomes clear: reliability will suffer. And we have even greater
flexibility here: perhaps running at <em>N</em> + 2 is not actually sufficient or
optimal for this service, and some other deployment plan would be more
suitable.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="selecting intent level" id="idm140203533827936"></a>So what level of intent should be used by intent-driven capacity
planning? Ideally, all levels of intent should be supported together,
with services benefiting the more they shift to specifying intent
versus implementation. In Google’s experience, services tend to
achieve the best wins as they cross to step 3: good degrees of
flexibility are available, and the ramifications of this request are
in higher-level and understandable terms. Particularly sophisticated
services may aim for step 4.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Dependencies"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533823648">
<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>Services at Google depend on many other
infrastructure and user-facing services, and these dependencies
heavily influence where a service can be placed. For example, imagine
user-facing service Foo, which depends upon Bar, an infrastructure
storage service. Foo expresses a requirement that Bar must be located
within 30 milliseconds of network latency of Foo. This requirement has
important repercussions for where we place both Foo <em>and</em> Bar, and
intent-driven capacity planning must take these constraints into
account.</p>

<p>Furthermore, production dependencies are nested: to build upon the
preceding example, imagine service Bar has its own dependencies on Baz, a
lower-level distributed storage service, and Qux, an application
management service. Therefore, where we can now place Foo depends on
where we can place Bar, Baz, and Qux. A given set of production
dependencies can be shared, possibly with different stipulations
around intent.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Performance metrics"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533820256">
<h3>Performance metrics</h3>

<p>Demand for one service trickles down to
result in demand for one or more other services. Understanding the
chain of dependencies helps formulate the general scope of the bin
packing problem, but we still need more information about expected
resource usage. How many compute resources does service Foo need to
serve <em>N</em> user queries? For every <em>N</em> queries of service Foo, how many
Mbps of data do we expect for service Bar?</p>

<p>Performance metrics are the glue between dependencies. They convert
from one or more higher-level resource type(s) to one or more lower-level resource type(s). Deriving appropriate performance metrics for a
service can involve load testing and resource usage monitoring.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Prioritization"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533816656">
<h3>Prioritization</h3>

<p>Inevitably, resource constraints result in
trade-offs and hard decisions: of the many requirements that all
services have, which requirements should be sacrificed in the face of
insufficient capacity?</p>

<p>Perhaps <em>N</em> + 2 redundancy for service Foo is more important than <em>N</em> + 1 redundancy for service Bar. Or perhaps the feature launch of <em>X</em> is less
important than <em>N</em> + 0 redundancy for service Baz.</p>

<p>Intent-driven planning forces these decisions to be made
transparently, openly, and consistently. Resource constraints entail
the same trade-offs, but all too often, the prioritization can be ad
hoc and opaque to service owners. Intent-based planning allows
prioritization to be as granular or coarse as needed.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Introduction to Auxon"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203533811600">
<h2>Introduction to Auxon</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="Auxon implementation" id="IBCPauxon18"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Auxon case study" id="auxon2"></a>Auxon is Google’s implementation of an intent-based capacity planning
and resource allocation solution, and a prime example of an
SRE-designed and developed software engineering product: it was built
by a small group of software engineers and a technical program manager
within SRE over the course of two years.  Auxon is a perfect case
study to demonstrate how software development can be fostered within
SRE.</p>

<p>Auxon is actively used to plan the use of many millions of dollars of
machine resources at Google. It has become a critical component of
capacity planning for several major divisions within Google.</p>

<p>As a product, Auxon provides the means to collect intent-based
descriptions of a service’s resource requirements and dependencies.
These user intents are expressed as requirements for how the owner
would like the service to be provisioned. Requirements might be
specified as a request like, “My service must be <em>N</em> + 2 per continent” or
“The frontend servers must be no more than 50 ms away from the backend
servers.”  Auxon collects this information either via a user
configuration language or via a programmatic API, thus translating
human intent into machine-parseable constraints. Requirements can be
prioritized, a feature that’s useful if resources are insufficient
to meet all requirements, and therefore trade-offs must be made. These
requirements—the intent—are ultimately represented internally as a
giant mixed-integer or linear program. Auxon solves the linear
program, and uses the resultant bin packing solution to formulate an
allocation plan for resources.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="nplus2" id="idm140203533805248"></a></p>

</div></figure>

<p><em>Performance Data</em> describes how a service scales: for every unit of
demand <em>X</em> in cluster <em>Y</em>, how many units of dependency <em>Z</em> are used? This
scaling data may be derived in a number of ways depending on the
maturity of the service in question. Some services are load tested,
while others infer their scaling based upon past performance.</p>

<p><em>Per-Service Demand Forecast Data</em> describes the usage trend for
forecasted demand signals. Some services derive their future usage
from demand forecasts—a forecast of queries per second broken down
by continent. Not all services have a demand forecast: some services
(e.g., a storage service like Colossus) derive their demand purely
from services that depend upon them.</p>

<p><em>Resource Supply</em> provides data about the availability of base-level,
fundamental resources: for example, the number of machines expected to
be available for use at a particular point in the future. In linear
program terminology, the resource supply acts as an <em>upper bound</em> that
limits how services can grow and where services can be placed.
Ultimately, we want to make the best use of this resource supply as
the intent-based description of the combined group of services allows.</p>

<p><em>Resource Pricing</em> provides data about how much base-level,
fundamental resources cost. For instance, the cost of machines may
vary globally based upon the space/power charges of a given facility.
In linear program terminology, the prices inform the overall
calculated costs, which act as the <em>objective</em> that we want to
minimize.</p>

<p><em>Intent Config</em> is the key to how intent-based information is fed to
Auxon. It defines what constitutes a service, and how services relate
to one another. The config ultimately acts as a configuration layer
that allows all the other components to be wired together. It’s
designed to be human-readable and configurable.</p>

<p><em>Auxon Configuration Language Engine</em> acts based upon the information
it receives from the Intent Config. This component formulates a
machine-readable request (a protocol buffer that can be
understood by the Auxon Solver. It applies light sanity checking to
the configuration, and is designed to act as the gateway between the
human-configurable intent definition and the machine-parseable
optimization request.</p>

<p><em>Auxon Solver</em> is the brain of the tool. It formulates the giant
mixed-integer or linear program based upon the optimization request
received from the Configuration Language Engine. It is designed to be
very scalable, which allows the solver to run in parallel upon
hundreds or even thousands of machines running within Google’s
clusters. In addition to mixed-integer linear programming toolkits,
there are also components within the Auxon Solver that handle tasks
such as scheduling, managing a pool of workers, and descending
decision trees.</p>

<p><em>Allocation Plan</em> is the output of the Auxon Solver. It prescribes
which resources should be allocated to which services in what
locations. It is the computed implementation details of the
intent-based definition of the capacity planning problem’s
requirements. The Allocation Plan also includes information about any
requirements that could not be satisfied—for example, if a requirement
couldn’t be met due to a lack of resources, or competing requirements
that were otherwise too strict.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="IBCPauxon18" id="idm140203533789280"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="auxon2" id="idm140203533788336"></a></p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Requirements and Implementation: Successes and Lessons Learned"><div class="sect2" id="idm140203533787344">
<h2>Requirements and Implementation: Successes and Lessons Learned</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="requirements and implementation" id="idm140203533786160"></a>Auxon was first imagined by an SRE and a technical program manager who had separately been tasked by their respective teams with
capacity planning large portions of Google’s infrastructure. Having
performed manual capacity planning in spreadsheets, they were well
positioned to understand the inefficiencies and opportunities for
improvement through automation, and the features such a tool might
require.</p>

<p>Throughout Auxon’s development, the SRE team behind the product
continued to be deeply involved in the production world. The
team maintained a role in on-call rotations for several of Google’s
services, and participated in design discussions and technical
leadership of these services. Through these ongoing interactions, the
team was able to stay grounded in the production world: they acted as
both the consumer and developer of their own product. When the product
failed, the team was directly impacted. Feature requests were informed
through the team’s own firsthand experiences. Not only did
firsthand experience of the problem space buy a huge sense of
ownership in the product’s success, but it also helped give the product
credibility and legitimacy within SRE.</p>










<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Approximation"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533783264">
<h3>Approximation</h3>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="deploying approximation" id="idm140203533782128"></a>Don’t focus on perfection and purity of solution, especially if the
bounds of the problem aren’t well known. Launch and iterate.</p>

<p>Any sufficiently complex software engineering effort is bound
to encounter uncertainty as to how a component should be designed or
how a problem should be tackled. Auxon met with such uncertainty early
in its development because the linear programming world was uncharted
territory for the team members. The limitations of linear programming,
which seemed to be a central part of how the product would likely
function, were not well understood. To address the team’s
consternation over this insufficiently understood dependency, we opted
to initially build a simplified solver engine (the so-called “Stupid
Solver”) that applied some simple heuristics as to how services should
be arranged based upon the user’s specified requirements. While the
Stupid Solver would never yield a truly optimal solution, it gave the
team a sense that our vision for Auxon was achievable even if we
didn’t build something perfect from day one.</p>

<p>When deploying approximation to help speed development, it’s important
to undertake the work in a way that allows the team to make future
enhancements and revisit approximation. In the case of the Stupid
Solver, the entire solver interface was abstracted away within Auxon
such that the solver internals could be swapped out at a later date.
Eventually, as we built confidence in a unified linear programming
model, it was a simple operation to switch out the Stupid Solver for
something, well, smarter.</p>

<p>Auxon’s product requirements also had some unknowns. Building
software with fuzzy requirements can be a frustrating challenge, but
some degree of uncertainty  need not be a showstopper. Use this
fuzziness as an incentive to ensure that the software is designed to
be both general and modular. For instance, one of the aims of the
Auxon project was to integrate with automation systems within Google
to allow an Allocation Plan to be directly enacted on production
(assigning resources and turning up/turning down/resizing services as
appropriate). However, at the time, the world of automation systems
was in a great deal of flux, as a huge variety of approaches were in use. Rather than try to design unique
solutions to allow Auxon to work with each individual tool, we instead
shaped the Allocation Plan to be universally useful such that these
automation systems could work on their own integration points. This
“agnostic” approach became key to Auxon’s process for onboarding new
customers, because it allowed customers to begin using Auxon without
switching to a particular turnup automation tool, forecasting tool, or
performance data tool.</p>

<p>We also leveraged modular designs to deal with fuzzy requirements when
building a model of machine performance within Auxon. Data on future
machine platform performance (e.g., CPU) was scarce, but our users
wanted a way to model various scenarios of machine power. We
abstracted away the machine data behind a single interface, allowing
the user to swap in different models of future machine performance. We
later extended this modularity further, based on increasingly defined
requirements, to provide a simple machine performance modeling library
that worked within this interface.</p>

<p>If there’s one theme to draw from our Auxon case study, it’s that the
old motto of “launch and iterate” is particularly relevant in SRE
software development projects. Don’t wait for the perfect design;
rather, keep the overall vision in mind while moving ahead with design
and development. When you encounter areas of uncertainty, design the
software to be flexible enough so that if process or strategy changes
at a higher level, you don’t incur a huge rework cost. But at the same
time, stay grounded by making sure that general solutions have a real-world–specific implementation that demonstrates the utility of the
design.</p>

<h2>Raising Awareness and Driving Adoption</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intent-based capacity planning" data-secondary="driving adoption of" id="IBCPraise18"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="encouraging" id="idm140203533772064"></a>As with any product, SRE-developed software must be designed with
knowledge of its users and requirements. It needs to drive adoption
through utility, performance, and demonstrated ability to both benefit
Google’s production reliability goals and to better the lives of
SREs. The process of socializing a product and achieving buy-in across
an organization is key to the project’s success.</p>

<p>Don’t underestimate the effort required to raise awareness and
interest in your software product—a single presentation or email
announcement isn’t enough. Socializing internal software tools to a
large audience demands all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A consistent and coherent approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User advocacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sponsorship of senior engineers and management, to whom you will have
to demonstrate the utility of your product</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to consider the perspective of the customer in making
your product usable. An engineer might not have the time or
the inclination to dig into the source code to figure out how to use a
tool. Although internal customers are generally more tolerant of rough
edges and early alphas than external customers, it’s still necessary
to provide documentation. SREs are busy, and if your solution is too
difficult or confusing, they will write their own solution.</p>










<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Set expectations"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533765568">
<h3>Set expectations</h3>

<p>When an engineer with years of familiarity in a
problem space begins designing a product, it’s easy to imagine a
utopian end-state for the work. However, it’s important to
differentiate aspirational goals of the product from minimum success
criteria (or Minimum Viable Product). Projects can lose credibility
and fail by promising too much, too soon; at the same time, if a
product doesn’t promise a sufficiently rewarding outcome, it can be
difficult to overcome the necessary activation energy to convince
internal teams to try something new. Demonstrating steady, incremental
progress via small releases raises user confidence in your team’s
ability to deliver useful software.</p>

<p>In the case of Auxon, we struck a balance by planning a long-term
roadmap alongside short-term fixes. Teams were promised that:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Any onboarding and configuration efforts would provide the
immediate benefit of alleviating the pain of manually bin packing
short-term resource requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As additional features were developed for Auxon, the same
configuration files would carry over and provide new, and much
broader, long-term cost savings and other benefits. The project road
map enabled services to quickly determine if their use cases or
required features weren’t implemented in the early versions.
Meanwhile, Auxon’s iterative development approach fed into development
priorities and new milestones for the road map.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Identify appropriate customers"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533759920">
<h3>Identify appropriate customers</h3>

<p>The team developing Auxon realized that a one-size solution might not
fit all; many larger teams already had home-grown solutions for
capacity planning that worked passably well. While their custom tools
weren’t perfect, these teams didn’t experience sufficient pain in the
capacity planning process to try a new tool, especially an alpha
release with rough edges.</p>

<p>The initial versions of Auxon intentionally targeted teams that had no
existing capacity planning processes in place. Because these teams would
have to invest configuration effort whether they adopted an existing
tool or our new approach, they were interested in adopting the newest
tool. The early successes Auxon achieved with these teams demonstrated
the utility of the project, and turned the customers themselves into
advocates for the tool. Quantifying the usefulness of the product
proved further beneficial; when we onboarded one of Google’s Business
Areas, the team authored a case study detailing the process and
comparing the before and after results. The time savings and reduction
of human toil alone presented a huge incentive for other teams to give
Auxon a try.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Customer service"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533756720">
<h3>Customer service</h3>

<p>Even though software developed within SRE targets an audience of TPMs
and engineers with high technical proficiency, any sufficiently
innovative software still presents a learning curve to new
users. Don’t be afraid to provide white glove customer support for
early adopters to help them through the onboarding process. Sometimes
automation also entails a host of emotional concerns, such as fear
that someone’s job will be replaced by a shell script. By working
one-on-one with early users, you can address those fears personally,
and demonstrate that rather than owning the toil of performing a
tedious task manually, the team instead owns the configurations,
processes, and ultimate results of their technical work. Later
adopters are convinced by the happy examples of early adopters.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because Google’s SRE teams are distributed across the
globe, early-adopter advocates for a project are particularly
beneficial, because they can serve as local experts for other teams
interested in trying out the project.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Designing at the right level"><div class="sect3" id="idm140203533753648">
<h3>Designing at the right level</h3>

<p>An idea that we’ve termed <em>agnosticism</em>—writing the software to be
generalized to allow myriad data sources as input—was a key principle
of Auxon’s design.  Agnosticism meant that customers weren’t required
to commit to any one tool in order to use the Auxon framework. This
approach allowed Auxon to remain of sufficient general utility even as
teams with divergent use cases began to use it. We approached
potential users with the message, “come as you are; we’ll work with
what you’ve got.” By avoiding over-customizing for one or two big
users, we achieved broader adoption across the
organization and lowered the barrier to entry for new services.</p>

<p>We’ve also consciously endeavored to avoid the pitfall of defining
success as 100% adoption across the organization. In many cases, there
are diminishing returns on closing the last mile to enable a feature
set that is sufficient for every service in the long tail at Google.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="IBCPraise18" id="idm140203533750560"></a></p>

we’ve found great benefit from creating a seed team that combines
generalists who are able to get up to speed quickly on a new topic
with engineers possessing a breadth of knowledge and experience. A
diversity of experiences covers blind spots as well as the pitfalls of
assuming that every team’s use case is the same as yours.</p>

<p>It’s essential for your team to establish a working relationship
with necessary specialists, and for your engineers to be comfortable
working in a new problem space. For SRE teams at most companies,
venturing into this new problem space requires  outsourcing tasks or
working with consultants, but SRE teams at larger organizations may be
able to partner with in-house experts. During the initial phases of
conceptualizing and designing Auxon, we presented our design document
to Google’s in-house teams that specialize in Operations Research and
Quantitative Analysis in order to draw upon their expertise in the
field and to bootstrap the Auxon team’s knowledge about capacity
planning.</p>

<p>As project development continued and Auxon’s feature set grew more
broad and complex, the team acquired members with backgrounds in
statistics and mathematical optimization, which at a smaller company
might be akin to bringing an outside consultant in-house. These new
team members were able to identify areas for improvement when the
project’s basic functionality was complete and adding finesse had
become our top priority.</p>

<p>The right time to engage specialists will, of course, vary from
project to project. As a rough guideline, the project should be
successfully off the ground and demonstrably successful, such that the
skills of the current team would be significantly bolstered by the
additional expertise.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="SREintent18" id="idm140203533740640"></a></p>

<h1>Fostering Software Engineering in SRE</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="fostering" id="idm140203533738064"></a>What makes a project a good candidate to take the leap from one-off
tool to fully fledged software engineering effort? Strong positive
signals include engineers with firsthand experience in the relative
domain who are interested in working on the project, and a target user
base that is highly technical (and therefore able to provide
high-signal bug reports during the early phases of development). The
project should provide noticeable benefits, such as reducing toil
for SREs, improving an existing piece of infrastructure, or
streamlining a complex process.</p>

<p>It’s important for the project to fit into the overall set of
objectives for the organization, so that engineering leaders can weigh
its potential impact and subsequently advocate for your project, both
with their reporting teams and with other teams that might interface
with their teams. Cross-organizational socialization and review help
prevent disjoint or overlapping efforts, and a product that can easily
be established as furthering a department-wide objective is easier to
staff and support.</p>

<p>What makes a poor candidate project? Many of the same red flags you
might instinctively identify in any software project, such as software
that touches many moving parts at once, or software design that
requires an all-or-nothing approach that prevents iterative
development. Because Google SRE teams are currently organized around
the services they run, SRE-developed projects are particularly at risk
of being overly specific work that only benefits a small percentage of
the organization. Because team incentives are aligned primarily to
provide a great experience for the users of one particular service,
projects often fail to generalize to a broader use case as
standardization across SRE teams comes in second place. At the
opposite end of the spectrum, overly generic frameworks can be equally
problematic; if a tool strives to be too flexible and too universal,
it runs the risk of not quite fitting any use case, and therefore
having insufficient value in and of itself. Projects with grand scope
and abstract goals often require significant development effort, but
lack the concrete use cases required to deliver end-user benefit on a
reasonable time frame.</p>

<p>As an example of a broad use case: a
layer-3 load balancer developed by Google SREs proved so successful over the
years that it was repurposed as a customer-facing product offering
via Google Cloud Load Balancer <a data-type="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/bibliography01.html#Eis16">[Eis16]</a>.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="staffing and development time" id="idm140203533731024"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="team building" data-secondary="staffing and development time" id="idm140203533730048"></a>SREs are often generalists, as the
desire to learn breadth-first instead of depth-first lends itself well
to understanding the bigger picture (and there are few pictures bigger
than the intricate inner workings of modern technical infrastructure).
These engineers often have strong coding and software development
skills, but may not have the traditional SWE experience of being part
of a product team or having to think about customer feature requests.
A quote from an engineer on an early SRE software development project
sums up the conventional SRE approach to software: “I have a design
doc; why do we need requirements?” Partnering with engineers, TPMs, or
PMs who are familiar with user-facing software development can help
build a team software development culture that brings together the
best of both software product development and hands-on production
experience.</p>

<p>Dedicated, noninterrupted, project work time is essential to any
software development effort. Dedicated project time is necessary to
enable progress on a project, because it’s nearly impossible to write
code—much less to concentrate on larger, more impactful
projects—when you’re thrashing between several tasks in the course
of an hour. Therefore, the ability to work on a software project
without interrupts is often an attractive reason for engineers to
begin working on a development project. Such time must be aggressively
defended.</p>

<p>The majority of software products developed within SRE begin as side
projects whose utility leads them to grow and become formalized. At
this point, a product may branch off into one of several possible
directions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Remain a grassroots effort developed in engineers’ spare time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become established as a formal project through structured processes
(see <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:nopage" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com//library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch18.html#xref_auxon_sidebar">“Getting There”</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain executive sponsorship from within
SRE leadership to expand into a fully staffed software development
effort</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in any of these scenarios—and this is a point worth
stressing—it’s essential that the SREs involved in any development
effort continue working as SREs instead of becoming full-time
developers embedded in the SRE organization. Immersion in the world of
production gives SREs performing development work an invaluable
perspective, as they are both the creator and the customer for any
product.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Getting There"><div class="sect2" id="xref_auxon_sidebar">
<h2>Getting There</h2>

<p>If you like the idea of organized software development in SRE, you’re
probably wondering how to introduce a software development model to an
SRE organization focused on production support.</p>

<p>First, recognize that this goal is as much an organizational change as
it is a technical challenge. SREs are used to working closely with
their teammates, quickly analyzing and reacting to problems.
Therefore, you’re working against the natural instinct of an SRE to
quickly write some code to meet their immediate needs. If your SRE
team is small, this approach may not be problematic. However, as your
organization grows, this ad hoc approach won’t scale, instead
resulting in largely functional, yet narrow or single-purpose, software
solutions that can’t be shared, which inevitably lead to duplicated
efforts and wasted time.</p>

<p>Next, think about what you want to achieve by developing software in
SRE. Do you just want to foster better software development practices
within your team, or are you interested in software development that
produces results that can be used across teams, possibly as a standard
for the organization? In larger established organizations, the latter
change will take time, possibly spanning multiple years. Such a change
needs to be tackled on multiple fronts, but has a higher payback. The
following are some guidelines from Google’s experience:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Create and communicate a clear message</dt>
<dd>
<p>It’s important to define and communicate your strategy, plans,
and—most importantly—the benefits SRE gains from this effort. SREs
are a skeptical lot (in fact, skepticism is a trait for which we
specifically hire); an SRE’s initial response to such an effort will
likely be, “that sounds like too much overhead” or “it will never
work.”  Start by making a compelling case of how this strategy will
help SRE; for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistent and supported software solutions speed ramp-up for new SREs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the number of ways to perform the same task
allows the entire department to benefit from the skills any single
team has developed, thus making knowledge and effort portable across
teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When SREs start to ask questions about <em>how</em> your strategy will work,
rather than <em>if</em> the strategy should be pursued, you know you’ve
passed the first hurdle.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Evaluate your organization’s capabilities</dt>
<dd>
<p>SREs have many skills, but it’s relatively common for an SRE to lack
experience as part of a team that built and shipped a product to a set
of users. In order to develop useful software, you’re effectively
creating a product team. That team includes required roles and skills
that your SRE organization may not have formerly demanded. Will
someone play the role of product manager, acting as the customer
advocate? Does your tech lead or project manager have the skills
and/or experience to run an agile development process?</p>

<p>Begin filling these gaps by taking advantage of the skills already
present in your company. Ask your product development team to help you
establish agile practices via training or coaching. Solicit consulting
time from a product manager to help you define product requirements
and prioritize feature work. Given a large enough software-development
opportunity, there may be a case to hire dedicated people for these
roles. Making the case to hire for these roles is easier once you have
some positive experiment results.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Launch and iterate</dt>
<dd>
<p>As you initiate an SRE software development program, your efforts will
be followed by many watchful eyes. It’s important to establish
credibility by delivering some product of value in a reasonable amount
of time.  Your first round of products should aim for relatively
straightforward and achievable targets—ones without controversy or
existing solutions. We also found success in pairing this approach
with a six-month rhythm of product update releases that provided
additional useful features. This release cycle allowed teams to focus
on identifying the right set of features to build, and then building
those features while simultaneously learning how to be a productive
software development team. After the initial launch, some Google teams
moved to a push-on-green model for even faster delivery and feedback.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Don’t lower your standards</dt>
<dd>
<p>As you start to develop software, you may be tempted to cut corners.
Resist this urge by holding yourself to the same standards to which
your product development teams are held. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask yourself: if this product were created by a separate dev team,
would you onboard the product?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your solution enjoys broad
adoption, it may become critical to SREs in order to successfully
perform their jobs. Therefore, reliability is of utmost importance. Do
you have proper code review practices in place? Do you have end-to-end
or integration testing? Have another SRE team review the product for
production readiness as they would if onboarding any other <span class="keep-together">service</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It takes a long time to build credibility for your software
development efforts, but only a short time to lose credibility due to
a misstep.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software engineering in SRE" data-secondary="benefits of" id="idm140203533698656"></a>Software engineering projects within Google SRE have flourished as the
organization has grown, and in many cases the lessons learned from and
successful execution of earlier software development projects have
paved the way for subsequent endeavors. The unique hands-on production
experience that SREs bring to developing tools can lead to innovative
approaches to age-old problems, as seen with the development of Auxon
to address the complex problem of capacity planning. SRE-driven
software projects are also noticeably beneficial to the company in
developing a sustainable model for supporting services at scale. Because
SREs often develop software to streamline inefficient processes or
automate common tasks, these projects mean that the SRE team doesn’t
have to scale linearly with the size of the services they support.
Ultimately, the benefits of having SREs devoting some of
their time to software development are reaped by the company, the SRE
organization, and the SREs themselves.</p>
